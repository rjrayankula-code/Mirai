    <h1>Hi, it's nice to meet you</h1>

    <p><strong>I'm Dr. Jegnasha Patel—Jiggy for short!</strong></p>

    <p>
      I'm a passionate entrepreneur with a big heart for promoting health and well-being in our world,
      particularly by empowering children and supporting the parents and caregivers who nurture them.
    </p>

    <p>
      By day, I'm a board-certified pediatric occupational therapist with over seven years of experience working
      in early intervention and outpatient pediatric clinics. My journey as an OT has been both rewarding and
      challenging—shaping me into a more patient, compassionate, and understanding person.
    </p>

    <p>
      Working with children of all abilities has given me a front-row seat to the joy and resilience of little ones.
      But it has also opened my eyes to the gaps that exist in the resources available to families—things like
      unanswered questions about child development or the lack of accessible tools for understanding their child's
      unique needs.
    </p>

    <p>
      As I reflect on the incredible journey of serving children and families in traditional settings, I feel a deep
      sense of gratitude, but I also feel inspired to do more. That's why I'm taking a leap of faith and launching
      <strong>Mirai</strong>—a space that goes back to the roots of why I became an OT.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Mirai</strong> means "future," and at its heart, it is about becoming a guiding light for tomorrow—
      a beacon of hope and knowledge for families, therapists, and educators. It's a place where parents and
      caregivers can find the guidance and tools they need to support their child's development.
    </p>

    <p>
      Together, we are the luminaries—illuminating the path toward a world where every child can thrive through
      developmentally appropriate play while their support system feels empowered and equipped to make that vision
      a reality.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is more than just a business for me—it's a mission, one born from a genuine passion for creating a
      brighter future for our community. Thank you for being here.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Here's to building brighter tomorrows—together.</strong></p>
